This project is an implementation of the classic Battleship game.

Requirements:

* Windows machine or Mono installed
* Unix command line (use something like MSYS2 on Windows)

To get started:

1. Clone project
1. Open command line and cd to project root
1. Build using `csbuild.sh`
1. Run using `run.sh` -- you can also find the executable in the bin folder, but this script makes it simpler to build and run from the command line.
