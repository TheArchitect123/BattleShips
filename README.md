## 5. Gameplay
 1. This is a turn-based game.
 2. The player will call out where they think an enemy ship is. ie: `D-4`
 3. The player who is recieving the attack will be honest and say if it was a `hit` or `miss`.
 4. If `hit` a red marker is placed on top of the ship.  and the attacking player also can place a flag in that location to remember where they have attacked.
