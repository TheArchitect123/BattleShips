## 4. User Interface
The player is presented with buttons and icons that the player can select with the mouse.

Clicking the 'menu' button will bring the player back to the menu.

The player can click on the board to place ships in the pre-game, and click again to choose a coordinate for their guess.

Upon clicking exit, the game will close.



## 5. Gameplay
 1. This is a turn-based game.
 2. The player will call out where they think an enemy ship is. ie: `D-4`
 3. The player who is recieving the attack will be honest and say if it was a `hit` or `miss`.
 4. If `hit` a red marker is placed on top of the ship.  and the attacking player also can place a flag in that location to remember where they have attacked.
